All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [1.1.0] - 2022-02-07

### Added

- The parameter '--image-stdin' allows reading image from standard input stream,
  meaning that you can for example use piping to pass the image instead of
  using the '--image' parameter which reads the image from a file.

- Support for .xyls files (x,y lists).
  New parameters are: --xyls, --xyls-stdin, --xyls-imagesize.
  The --image* and --xyls* parameters are mutually exclusive,
  and --xyls and --xyls-stdin always requires --xyls-imagesize to be set as 
  well.

### Fixed

- WatneyAstrometry.Core v1.0.1 fix: in nearby solves the min-max range is now 
  correctly checked, so that min radius can never be entered as 0.
  This bug existed in 1.0.0 which caused the CLI solver to always fail
  when using the '--use-fits-headers' parameter.
  


## [1.0.0] - 2022-01-30

- First release.
