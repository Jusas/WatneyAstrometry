## [CURRENT_VERSION_TAG] - CURRENT_VERSION_RELEASE_DATE

### Changed

- Major performance improvements to blind solves.

- Introduced new database format (version 3) which introduces separate index 
  files for faster database initialization and the quads are now packed into
  smaller size, dropping the database size by 18%. The new Watney version
  is not compatible with version 2 database files due to major data 
  structure changes.

### Added

- The parameter '--image-stdin' allows reading image from standard input stream,
  meaning that you can for example use piping to pass the image instead of
  using the '--image' parameter which reads the image from a file.

- Support for .xyls files (x,y lists).
  New parameters are: --xyls, --xyls-stdin, --xyls-imagesize.
  The --image* and --xyls* parameters are mutually exclusive,
  and --xyls and --xyls-stdin always requires --xyls-imagesize to be set as 
  well.

### Fixed

- WatneyAstrometry.Core fix: in nearby solves the min-max range is now 
  correctly checked, so that min radius can never be entered as 0.
  This bug existed in 1.0.0 which caused the CLI solver to always fail
  when using the '--use-fits-headers' parameter.
