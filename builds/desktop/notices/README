The Watney Astrometric Solver is a tool for astrophotography applications and
can be used to solve the RA, Dec coordinates, the field size, rotation and
other things from the images. 


INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

The executable included in the package is a self contained .NET 6 application.
Therefore it has no external library dependencies. Simply extract the package
to a directory of your choosing.

The application however requires Watney quad database files to function. 
The application can download these if you let it. Otherwise you may download
them manually from the project Github page, under releases:
https://github.com/Jusas/WatneyAstrometry/releases

Extract the database files to any directory of your choosing, and configure
the database directory from application settings.


OPERATION
===============================================================================

The desktop application demonstrates the use of the Watney solver in a
custom application. You can solve images using both Blind and Nearvy modes,
and detected stars and Deep Sky Objects can be visualized among other things.
