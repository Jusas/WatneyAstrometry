The Watney Astrometric Solver is a tool for astrophotography applications and
can be used to solve the RA, Dec coordinates, the field size, rotation and
other things from the images. 

Note: this is an early release, and may be a bit unpolished with documentation
a bit lacking. Sorry!


INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

The executable included in the package is a self contained .NET 5 application.
Therefore it has no external library dependencies. Simply extract the package
to a directory of your choosing.

The application however requires Watney quad database files to function. 
These can be downloaded from the project Github page, under releases:
https://github.com/Jusas/WatneyAstrometry/releases

Extract the database files to any directory of your choosing, and configure
the database directory from the configuration file, watney-solve-config.yml.


OPERATION
===============================================================================

Short version, run:

watney-solve blind
watney-solve nearby

This will display the help for the modes in its entirety.

So, the solver CLI application has two main modes: blind and nearby solve.

Blind solving requires minimal parameters to operate, and is designed to
solve fields when no initial image center coordinate is known. Since it
needs to scan the sky thoroughly, it is noticeably slower than nearby solves.

Nearby solving requires either FITS headers with preliminary coordinates
(RA, DEC, OBJCTRA, OBJCTDEC, RA_OBJ, DEC_OBJ) and enough information to
determing the field size (PIXSIZE1, PIXSIZE2, FOCALLEN), or alternatively
those parameters can be specified via command line parameters. Nearby solve
simply tries to search the vicinity of the preliminary center coordinates to
find a solution and only needs to scan a small, well defined area and therefore
is a fast operation to perform.


OUTPUT
===============================================================================

The CLI solver can output both JSON and TSV (tab separated values), and can
write the output to STDOUT or to a file. If no errors occur, the application 
exits with exit code 0. Upon error, the application exits with exit code 1.
