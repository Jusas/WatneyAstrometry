The Watney Astrometric Solver is a tool for astrophotography applications and
can be used to solve the RA, Dec coordinates, the field size, rotation and
other things from the images. 

The API app this package contains provides the solver functionality via a 
REST API. The REST API contains both the Watney canonical API and the
Astrometry.net compatibility API.


INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

The executable included in the package is a self contained .NET 6 application.
Therefore it has no external library dependencies. Simply extract the package
to a directory of your choosing.

The application however requires Watney quad database files to function. 
These can be downloaded from the project Github page, under releases:
https://github.com/Jusas/WatneyAstrometry/releases

Extract the database files to any directory of your choosing, and configure
the database directory from the configuration file, config.yml.


OPERATION
===============================================================================

Short version, run:

./watney-api

This will start the Watney API and it starts to listen to requests in HTTP port
5000.

The standard configuration relating to solving is defined in config.yml.
To enable more verbose logging, or change any standard ASP.NET 6 API 
configuration settings you can create appsettings.json file, and define your
configuration there.

Example of enabling default log level to trace with appsettings.json:

{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Trace",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  }
}

To run the service on a different port, you may use the --urls argument:

./watney-api --urls="http://localhost:5090"


CONFIGURATION
===============================================================================

The main configuration is defined in config.yml.
It's quite well documented there.
