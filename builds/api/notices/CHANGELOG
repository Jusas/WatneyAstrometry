# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [1.2.3] - 2023-07-04

### Changed

- WatneyAstrometry.Core updated to v1.2.3 which introduces improved match 
  filtering. This mainly affects images with large field radiuses and
  massive amounts of stars visible, improving the solve accuracy. 
  Fields with tens of thousands of stars should now solve with better
  accuracy.



## [1.2.1] - 2023-04-14

### Fixed

- In API: When the API config file config.yml does not have limitThreads set
  at all, the API app will no longer crash on startup. This crash happened if 
  you were upgrading from v1.1.3 to v1.2.0 and you were still using your old 
  configuration, the reason being that the default limitThreads value was 
  incorrectly being set to 0 instead of -1.



## [1.2.0] - 2023-01-21

### Added

- Configuration option to allow limiting how many threads the solver can use:
  
  config.template.yml:
  limitThreads: -1

  By default the value is set to -1 which does not apply any limit, i.e.
  the used thread count will default to the number of your CPU logical cores. 
  If the host is running other processes as well, it can be useful to limit
  the number of threads that is allowed to be used by the solver.
  
  

## [1.1.4] - 2022-08-21

### Maintenance release

- Dependency SixLabors.ImageSharp library upgraded to 2.1.3.
  No changes to the interface or functionality.
  
  
  
## [1.1.3] - 2022-06-15

### Fixed

- Fixed the issue of truncating the exponent when writing long decimal 
  numbers with scientific notation to the solve result WCS FITS file headers.
  
  
  
## [1.1.2] - 2022-04-18

### Fixed

- Fixed exceptions with ARM processors when running in 32bit operating systems 
  ("A datatype misalignment was detected in a load or store instruction")
  which was unexpectedly caused by the previous quad database format changes.



## [1.1.1] - 2022-03-07

### Added

- 'ra_hms' and 'dec_dms' properties to solve result, for convenience. These
  are the RA, Dec coords in Hours Minutes Seconds and Degrees Minutes Seconds.
  
- New configuration item, 'starDetectionBgOffset'.
  The value allows tweaking the built-in star detection sensitivity. This was 
  added to allow including dimmer stars but note that too low values may cause
  noise to be interpreted as signal (values 2.0 .. 3.0 recommended).



## [1.1.0] - 2022-02-21

### Changed

- Major performance improvements to blind solves.

- Introduced new database format (version 3) which introduces separate index 
  files for faster database initialization and the quads are now packed into
  smaller size, dropping the database size by 18%. The new Watney version
  is not compatible with version 2 database files due to major data 
  structure changes.  

### Fixed

- WatneyAstrometry.Core fix: in nearby solves the min-max range is now 
  correctly checked, so that min radius can never be entered as 0.



## [1.0.0] - 2022-01-30

- First release.
