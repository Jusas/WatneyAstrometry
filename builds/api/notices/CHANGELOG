## [CURRENT_VERSION_TAG] - CURRENT_VERSION_RELEASE_DATE

### Changed

- Major performance improvements to blind solves.

- Introduced new database format (version 3) which introduces separate index 
  files for faster database initialization and the quads are now packed into
  smaller size, dropping the database size by 18%. The new Watney version
  is not compatible with version 2 database files due to major data 
  structure changes.  

### Fixed

- WatneyAstrometry.Core fix: in nearby solves the min-max range is now 
  correctly checked, so that min radius can never be entered as 0.



## [1.0.0] - 2022-01-30

- First release.
