# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [CURRENT_VERSION_TAG] - CURRENT_VERSION_RELEASE_DATE

### Fixed

- Fixed the issue of truncating the exponent when writing long decimal 
  numbers with scientific notation to the solve result WCS FITS file headers.
  
  
  
## [1.1.2] - 2022-04-18

### Fixed

- Fixed exceptions with ARM processors when running in 32bit operating systems 
  ("A datatype misalignment was detected in a load or store instruction")
  which was unexpectedly caused by the previous quad database format changes.



## [1.1.1] - 2022-03-07

### Added

- 'ra_hms' and 'dec_dms' properties to solve result, for convenience. These
  are the RA, Dec coords in Hours Minutes Seconds and Degrees Minutes Seconds.
  
- New configuration item, 'starDetectionBgOffset'.
  The value allows tweaking the built-in star detection sensitivity. This was 
  added to allow including dimmer stars but note that too low values may cause
  noise to be interpreted as signal (values 2.0 .. 3.0 recommended).



## [1.1.0] - 2022-02-21

### Changed

- Major performance improvements to blind solves.

- Introduced new database format (version 3) which introduces separate index 
  files for faster database initialization and the quads are now packed into
  smaller size, dropping the database size by 18%. The new Watney version
  is not compatible with version 2 database files due to major data 
  structure changes.  

### Fixed

- WatneyAstrometry.Core fix: in nearby solves the min-max range is now 
  correctly checked, so that min radius can never be entered as 0.



## [1.0.0] - 2022-01-30

- First release.
